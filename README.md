
This Is currently an angular basic UI for the betterFlashCards project, 

The file structure Is feature based Instead of the traditional division to ``templates, services, componentes, etc..`` since I belive It's more scalable and developer convinient.

The [API Server](https://github.com/razawi/flash-cards-server) Is a more mature project and of course be sure to checkout the [full project doc](https://github.com/razawi/betterFlashCards)
